<p align="justify"> The Samaveda (Sanskrit: सामवेद, romanized: sāmaveda, from sāman "song" and veda "knowledge"), is the Veda of melodies and chants.<br>It is an ancient Vedic Sanskrit text, and part of the scriptures of Hinduism. One of the four Vedas, it is a liturgical text which consists of 1,875 verses. All but 75 verses have been taken from the Rigveda.<br>Three recensions of the Samaveda have survived, and variant manuscripts of the Veda have been found in various parts of India.<br>

While its earliest parts are believed to date from as early as the Rigvedic period, the existing compilation dates from the post-Rigvedic Mantra period of Vedic Sanskrit, between c. 1200 and 1000 BCE or "slightly rather later," roughly contemporary with the Atharvaveda and the Yajurveda.<br>

Embedded inside the Samaveda is the widely studied Chandogya Upanishad and Kena Upanishad, considered as primary Upanishads and as influential on the six schools of Hindu philosophy, particularly the Vedanta school.<br> The Samaveda set important foundations for the subsequent Indian music.

It is also referred to as Sama Veda.</p>
<p align="justify">The Samaveda comprises two major parts. The first part include four melody collections (gāna, गान) and the second part three verse "books" (ārcika, आर्चिक).A melody in the song books corresponds to a verse in the arcika books.The Gana collection is subdivided into Gramageya and Aranyageya, while the Arcika portion is subdivided into Purvarcika and Uttararcika portions.<br> The Purvarcika portion of the text has 585 single stanza verses and is organized in order of deities, while Uttararcika text is ordered by rituals.<br> The Gramageya melodies are those for public recitations, while Aranyageya melodies are for personal meditative use such as in the solitude of a forest. Typically, the Purvarcika collection were sung to melodies described in the Gramageya-Gānas index, and the rules of how the verses mapped to verses is described in the Sanskrit texts such as the Puspasutra.

Just like Rigveda, the early sections of Samaveda typically begin with Agni and Indra hymns but shift to abstract speculations and philosophy, and their meters too shifts in a descending order.The later sections of the Samaveda, states Witzel, have least deviation from substance of hymns they derive from Rigveda into songs.<br> The purpose of Samaveda was liturgical, and they were the repertoire of the udgātṛ or "singer" priests.</p>
